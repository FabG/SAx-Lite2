// Note for self: DON'T USE THIS CLASS for our little app (unless we move to another service)
// This won't work for our SAx Lite app as the SOAP Webservice will require a client
// to be generated to consume the data (see the "wsdl2objc" google tool)

// Class to handle the Xplore SOAP WebService
// We will use:
// - NSURL: location of the web application
// - NSURLRequest: all the data to communicate with the webserver
// - NSURLConnection: to make the connection to the webserver, sending the info in NSURLRequest
//                    and gathering the response from the server

// collecting the data returned from the request. (XML in our case). However, the data returned
// usually comes back in pieces, and it is the delegate’s job to collect the pieces and put

// This method will be called several times as the data arrives

// When a connection has finished retrieving all of the data from a web service, it sends the
// message connectionDidFinishLoading: to its delegate. In this method, you are guaranteed to
// have the complete response from the web service request and can start working with that data.
